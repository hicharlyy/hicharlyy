- 👋 Hi, I’m @hicharlyy
- 👀 I’m interested in languages and food!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, HTML, CSS and Russian.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing in particular right now, but I'm interested in eventually making language-learning games.
- 📫 How to reach me ... ping me here? I guess that's a thing you can do here? Hopefully, I'll remember to change this once I learn how to use Github.
